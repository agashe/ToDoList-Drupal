# TodoList-Drupal

This repository is the result of this [required task](https://github.com/linkdev-talent/drupal-interview-task) by link developments.

This is a simple todolist app (drupal module) , compatible with both drupal 7/8.

## Install

For drupal7 , type the following on your terminal of choice:

```
cd drupal7-docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Then you can access the server on http://localhost:8000
and the phpMyAdmin on http://localhost:8080

*All database access info can be found/edit in docker-compose.yml*

## Done Tasks
1- Show each user only his tasks.<br>
2- Create new permission to show all tasks.<br>
3- Show latest 5 tasks on home section.<br>
4- Fix CRON issue.<br>
5- Migrate the module to drupal8. (Actually i didn't much on this part since i face a lot of issues running drupal8 locally/docker)<br>

## My Rate
I think it's a good task to measure the developer skills , and also a good chance for those (like me) who don't know a lot about drupal , to try it.
